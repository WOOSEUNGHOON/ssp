At the domestic conference "정보보호학회 하계학술대회" (CISE-S'25) held in Gyeongju, Korea, from June 24 to 25, Ph.D student Heedong Yang participated. (with Master's students Seogyeong Cho and Sunha Park, Undergraduate students Mingyoung Ban and CCS Lab Jeongwoo Lee)

It was fun and meaningful to see what other korean students are working on in security research.

Heedong Yang presented a paper "COTS 바이너리의 1-day 취약점 탐지를 위한 Patch Presence Test 연구"
